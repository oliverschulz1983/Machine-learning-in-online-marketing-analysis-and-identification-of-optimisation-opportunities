# Machine-learning-in-online-marketing-analysis-and-identification-of-optimisation-opportunities.

For my graduent project at the Data Science Bootcamp, I analysed the online advertising results of a fictitious company using a freely available data set on Kaggle and prepared them visually in Tableau. 
I also used machine learning algorithms to create a sales forecast app with Streamlit. 
In the app, you can optimise the forecast, generated sales by setting various campaign parameters in real time - whereby the app provides you with the regression results including coefficient values as an aid.

Project Idea and Aims:
Challenge: Interpreting campaign results correctly and drawing the right conclusions from them. 
Aim: Optimising the results of future advertising campaigns through better data interpretation. 
How: Machine learning can help to better understand the results data and make better predictions.

The Data:
Source: Kaggle-Dataset "Online advertising performance data" => https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naniruddhan/online-advertising-digital-marketing-data
Description: This freely available dataset provides insights into the online advertising performance of a company referred to as "Company X" that has run 3 campaigns, with different ad formats and ad placements.
Period under review: 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020.
